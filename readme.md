# Repository Overview

This repository contains a collection of implementations and practice problems that are useful for learning algorithms and data structures. The projects here are organized into three main folders:

- **algorithms**: Contains generic, important algorithm implementations.
- **data_structures**: Includes implementations of various data structures—from basic ones to more advanced structures—as well as related LeetCode-style problems.
- **problems**: Hosts coding problems in the style of LeetCode to practice and improve my problem-solving skills.

> **Note:** Some implementations may be better or worse than others, both logically and syntactically. They are not all perfect or efficient—this is a work in progress as I practice.
